# Health Insurance Cross Sell Prediction

Cross selling is the process of offering an existing customer a product that is similar or compatible to the product that they already purchased. Acquiring a new customer is harder than retaining existing customers, which makes customer relationship a very important aspect for any business.

Cross selling can be an effective method to strengthen the relationship with the customer while also boosting the revenue of the business. When rightly done, it can:
1. improve the customer's experience with the existing product, or
2. solve some new problems for them.

Planning cross selling strategy
It is important to know which customer might be interested or uninterested in a product while planning the cross selling process. This helps to:
1. avoid any potential negative effects on the customer relationship due to the cross selling advertisement.
2. make efficient use of the communication and marketing efforts.

So we will use the data of past health insurance policy holders of our client to build models that can classify a customer as 'Interested" or "Not interested" in the vehicle insurance.
